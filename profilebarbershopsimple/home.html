				<h3>Men are coming back to barbers</h3>
				<p>In the midst of city noise and the dense daily routine, haircuts can be an oasis for men today as a place to escape. 
				Leather chairs, charming interiors, and easy-listening songs are some of the images you can feel in today's modern barbershop. 
				More than its function as a shaving place for men, barbershop began to offer services to "attract" the Adam in order to appear more confident.</p>
